  Autocorrelation function is useful to analyze \textit{memory} of obtained time-series data in general. The memory means correlation between data  \(A(t)\) and \(\tau\) delayed \(A(t + \tau ) \). This is often used by statistical researchers and signal engineer.

  In physics, Autocorrelation function appear in linear response theory. Our program package, CURP, is also based on this theory and use Autocorrelation function.
